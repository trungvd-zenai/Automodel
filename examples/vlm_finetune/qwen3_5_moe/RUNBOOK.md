# Runbook — Qwen3.6-35B-A3B agentic SFT

One file for the whole run: what the recipe is, what must not be changed, how to bring it
up on 1/2/4 nodes, what every measured configuration cost, and how to export a
base-identical checkpoint.

**v4_88k, v5_130k and v6_137k are the same recipe.** They differ only in the corpus
(§4); the model, parallelism, masking, launchers and export path are shared. Everything
below applies to all of them unless a corpus is named.

Merged from the four original notes (runbook; 2×B300 bring-up 2026-09-11; 8×H200 sweep
2026-09-12; 2×8×H200 multi-node 2026-09-14), keeping only the conclusions that still
matter.

---

## 1. What this run is

Full-parameter SFT of `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` on a private agentic-trajectory corpus,
FSDP2 + expert parallelism + the DeepEP dispatcher. The model is a VLM with a frozen
vision tower; its text backbone is hybrid — **30 GatedDeltaNet linear-attention layers
and 10 full-attention layers** (`layer_types` cycles `[linear ×3, full]`), 256 experts /
8 active, `head_dim: 256`, `vocab_size: 248320`, `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1`.

Three requirements. Do not trade any away for throughput without asking:

1. **Only the final assistant turn is supervised.** The corpora are turn-exploded (v4:
   87,552 rows over 9,835 unique trajectories), so supervising every turn would weight
   early turns by their ~9× duplication.
2. **Over-length rows are dropped, never truncated** — the supervised turn is at the tail.
3. **The exported checkpoint must stay architecturally identical to the base** and load
   with plain `transformers` as `Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`.

---

## 2. Do not undo these

Each was verified against the source and each fails **silently** if reverted.

| Do not | Why |
|---|---|
| Pass `max_length` to the collator | `default_collate_fn` flips to `padding="max_length"` once it is set (`vlm/collate_fns.py:1294`); a 163-token row would pad to 40,960. The cap is enforced offline instead. |
| Set `text_config.mtp_expert_hf_layout` | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B stores MTP experts **fused**; unset, the adapter infers it. (The sibling 122B config sets `split`.) |
| Set `num_nextn_predict_layers: 0` | `self.mtp = None`, so the 19 `mtp.*` tensors never reach the export while the copied `config.json` still declares `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1` → missing keys on load. Breaks requirement 3. |
| Hand TE a packed **mask** of any kind | TE's `padding_causal` contract is a 2-D `[batch, sequence]` padding mask. A 4-D block-causal mask silently became 6-D; an indexed document map collapses to a plain padding mask and bleeds across documents with **no error**. The packed recipe routes TE through `qkv_format="thd"` + `cu_seqlens` instead, and `components/attention/utils.py` now raises on a non-2-D mask. |
| Enable packing without `packed_sequence.label_post_hook_fn` | Packing forces pretokenization and selects the packed collater, so `dataloader.collate_fn` is **silently ignored** (`vlm/loader.py:341` precedes `:376`) and `last_turn_collate_fn` never runs. Labels then come from the stock builder, which supervises every assistant turn: ~36x more supervised tokens on this turn-exploded corpus, a different objective, and a plausible-looking loss. |
| Enable packing without `dataset.inject_fake_images: false` | Pretokenization defaults it to true, so every text-only row gets a synthetic image and is pushed through the frozen vision tower. |
| Lower `pack_size` below the pre-filter cap | The VLM neat packer books an over-long row at a *clamped* planning length (`neat_packing_vlm.py:817`), then drops it in `__getitem__` with only a `logger.warning` (`:584`); a bin holding just that sample returns a **padding-only pack** (`:616`). The LLM packer raises here, the VLM one does not. Rows run to 40,947, so 40,960 is the floor. For a fast rung shrink the corpus (`affine/make_short_subset.py`), not the pack. |
| Set `packing_format: thd` on this model | Unwired for the MoE variant: `cp_linear_attn.py:186` unpacks 3 dims from a `[tokens, hidden]` tensor and dies. Use `neat`. |
| Run without `flash-linear-attention` | GatedDeltaNet falls back to a pure-PyTorch reference path behind a bare `except ImportError`, **no warning** (`qwen3_5_moe/cp_linear_attn.py:126-142`) — silently degrades 30 of 40 layers. |
| Use `experts: gmm`/`te` without a DeepEP-family dispatcher | `BackendConfig.__post_init__` silently rewrites the pair to `(torch_mm, torch)`. |
| Narrow `_resolve_markers` to the thinking-enabled suffix only | See §3. |

---

## 3. Masking: the think block (decided 2026-09-11)

Rung 2 failed 8/8 on the first bring-up: `_resolve_markers` derived only the
`enable_thinking=True` suffix `<think>\n` (ids `[248068, 198]`), but a corpus without
`reasoning_content` renders every final turn as `<think>\n\n</think>\n\n` + content, and
`\n\n` is a single token (271) — so the trim never fired and the whole empty think block
stayed in the loss.

Fix in `affine/dataset.py`: derive **both** suffixes and trim whichever the supervised span
starts with, longest first. `affine/check_masking.py` accepts either.

**This is the one place the corpus changes the semantics of the run:**

- **No `reasoning_content` (v4_88k):** the whole empty block is masked, only the action
  text is supervised, and the model is trained for `enable_thinking=False` inference —
  **serve it with thinking disabled.**
- **With `reasoning_content` (v5_130k, v6_137k):** the final turn renders `<think>\n` +
  reasoning + `</think>\n\n` + content; only the opening tag is masked, so **the reasoning
  is supervised and the model is thinking-enabled** — the opposite of the v4 run.

Re-run rungs 2 and 3 whenever the corpus format changes. `affine/find_reasoning_rows.py`
answers which case a corpus is in.

---

## 4. The corpora

All are pre-filtered at 40,960 tokens with `affine/prefilter.py` (512 val rows,
seed 1234) and differ only in content.

| Corpus | rows | kept at 40,960 | mean / p50 tokens | tokens per epoch | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vuhaian/v4_88k` | 87,552 | 87,279 (99.69%) | 11,747 / 8,805 | 1.028 B | no — thinking-disabled |
| `vuhaian/v5_130k` | ~130 k | 128,575 train | 4,664 / 3,349 | 0.600 B | yes |
| `vuhaian/v6_137k` | 137,030 | 135,491 (98.88%) | 4,179 / 2,793 | 0.564 B | yes |

v4 length distribution (Qwen3.6 tokenizer, all 87,552 rows):

| p10 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p90 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1,537 | 3,091 | 8,805 | 18,570 | 27,271 | 31,120 | 37,097 | 45,024 | 68,378 |

Keep-rate by cap on v4: 16,384 → 70.4% · 24,576 → 85.9% · **40,960 → 99.7%** ·
49,152 → 99.96%. v6 has more long rows than v5 (949 above 32k vs 577) but the same
worst-case batch shape, so memory behaviour carries over unchanged between them.

**Signal density (v4):** supervised final-turn lengths p50 163, p90 844, p99 1,685,
max 1,801, mean 324 → 28.3M supervised tokens against 1.03B processed per epoch (2.8%),
an artifact of last-turn-only supervision on turn-exploded data. See §13.4.

## 5. Environment

```bash
# HF token. This repo has NO dotenv support; the repo-root .env is HF_TOKEN="hf_...".
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
export HF_HOME=/mnt/fast/hf          # 26 shards, ~67 GB — fast local disk
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
hf download Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B     # pre-stage so ranks don't race
```

**Use the container.** `deep_ep` needs nvshmem + rdma-core + a CUDA arch list; a source
build is painful. On the multi-node cluster the image is built from `deepep564/`:

```bash
docker build -t nemo-automodel:26.08.00-deepep564 examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/deepep564
```

It is `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-automodel:26.08.00` (torch 2.13.0a0+nv26.06, CUDA 13.3,
TE 2.14.1, FLA 0.4.2, DeepEP 1.2.1+4214430, transformers 5.12.1) plus two changes:
**DeepEP PR #564 backported** (required for any `ep_size` spanning nodes, §8.1) and
**torchao pinned to 0.14.0** (§8.3).

From source instead: `uv sync --locked --all-groups --extra moe --extra vlm --extra
vlm-media`. If you drop `--all-groups`, keep `--group dev`: `FusedLinearCrossEntropy`
imports `cut_cross_entropy`, which lives only there, and the run dies with an
`ImportError` *after* the model has loaded. `--all-groups` also builds MagiAttention,
unused here.

### Bare-metal traps (hit on the B300 box; an exact `uv sync` reverts the fixes)

- Outside `uv.lock` and needed on Blackwell: `nvidia-ml-py` (DeepEP imports `pynvml`),
  `transformer-engine{,-cu13,-torch}==2.18.0`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu13>=9.23`. Build
  `transformer-engine-torch` with `NVTE_WITH_NCCL_EP=0` (its NCCL-EP code includes a
  header torch 2.10 lacks) and run `uv pip install` from **outside** the repo.
- Build environment for the source packages (DeepEP, TE-torch, causal-conv1d,
  nv-grouped-gemm) on SM 10.x: `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="10.0;10.3"`,
  `NVTE_CUDA_ARCHS="100;103"`, and `CPATH=$CUDA_HOME/include/cccl` — CUDA 13 moved CCCL
  and DeepEP's host sources need it. `uv sync` has to run in two passes, because the MoE
  extra contains source builds that need torch already installed: `--extra fla` first,
  then `--extra moe`, then `--inexact ... --group dev`.
- DeepEP itself works on B300 (`tests/test_intranode.py --num-processes 2` passes), so the
  `dispatcher: hybridep` workaround from the `*_gb200.yaml` benchmarks is not needed.
- Do **not** apt-install `libnvidia-ml-dev`: it pulls `libnvidia-compute-*` and wedges
  dpkg in a container. CUDA 13's `cuda-nvml-dev-13-0` already provides `nvml.h`.
- The CUDA toolkit's `lib64` must not be on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at runtime — its cuBLASLt
  shadows the pip wheel's and TE fails to import
  (`undefined symbol: cublasLtGroupedMatrixLayoutInit_internal`).
- TE prefers a "system" cuDNN. Export
  `CUDNN_HOME=<venv>/lib/python3.12/site-packages/nvidia/cudnn` and put the venv's
  `nvidia/cudnn/lib` and `nvidia/nccl/lib` first on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or TE silently
  picks `UnfusedDotProductAttention` (§6).

### Bare-metal on a stock PyTorch image (2 × B300, no Docker, measured 2026-09-21)

Five more traps appear when the host has no CUDA toolkit and no `nemo-automodel` image.
Provisioned green in ~20 min with these; `examples/.../affine/` carries no installer, so
they are recorded here.

- **cuDNN reverts silently.** `torch 2.10.0+cu130` declares
  `nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.15.1.9` as an **exact** pin, so any resolving `uv pip install`
  *after* cuDNN 9.26 downgrades it back below the §6 floor — the install log shows
  `- nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.26.0.51 / + nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.15.1.9`. Install cuDNN **last**
  with `--no-deps` and assert `torch.backends.cudnn.version() >= 92300` rather than
  trusting it. Left unnoticed this presents as an OOM at `pack_size 40960`, not as a
  version error.
- **DeepEP needs rdma-core headers even on one node.** Its IBGDA sources include
  `<infiniband/mlx5dv.h>`: `apt-get install libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev`.
  `DISABLE_NVSHMEM=1` does **not** avoid this on the pinned hybrid-ep commit — the build
  still passes the nvshmem includes.
- **The nvshmem wheel has no unversioned soname.** `nvidia-nvshmem-cu13` ships only
  `libnvshmem_host.so.3`, while DeepEP links `-l:libnvshmem_host.so` (an exact filename),
  giving `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l:libnvshmem_host.so`. Symlink it.
- **`uv pip install` for DeepEP must run from outside the repo**, as above, but the reason
  is concrete: `[tool.uv.extra-build-dependencies]` declares
  `deep_ep = [{ requirement = "torch", match-runtime = true }]`, and with `--no-deps` torch
  is absent from the resolution, so uv aborts with "`torch` was declared as an extra build
  dependency with `match-runtime = true`, but was not found in the resolution".
- **The cuDNN frontend may pick the image's CUDA 12 runtime.** A stock PyTorch image keeps
  CUDA 12.8 under `/usr/local`, and the frontend warns `Multiple libcudart libraries found
  ... Using libcudart.so.12`. Export `CUDNN_FRONTEND_CUDART_LIB_NAME=libcudart.so.13`.
- A stock image also ships an unsigned `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list` for the same URL
  `cuda-keyring` signs, so adding the keyring fails with `E: Conflicting values set for
  option Signed-By`. Delete the unsigned list first.

---

## 6. Attention on Blackwell (SM 10.x)

Keep `attn: te`, but TE's fused attention at `head_dim=256` on SM 10.x needs **TE ≥ 2.18
and cuDNN ≥ 9.23** (TE PR #3056). Without them TE logs `FusedAttention=False` and
materializes `[heads, seq, seq]` scores — measured **259 GiB extra at 32k tokens**;
rung 6 died allocating 45.5 GiB in `backward()`.

Single GPU, attention fwd+bwd at 32k tokens:

| path | time | extra memory |
|---|---|---|
| TE 2.15 unfused | 591–1216 ms | ~259 GiB |
| PyTorch SDPA flash (`--model.backend.attn sdpa`) | 93.5 ms | 2.6 GiB |
| **TE 2.18 + cuDNN 9.26 fused** | **26.6 ms** | **2.6 GiB** |

Verify with `NVTE_DEBUG=1 NVTE_DEBUG_LEVEL=2`: the log must say
`Selected backend = FusedAttention`. (A patch to `components/attention/utils.py` that let
SDPA keep its flash kernel on right-padded batches was written, tested and reverted in
favour of the package fix.) H200 needs none of this.

---

## 7. Rungs

Run in order; 1–4 need no GPU and catch most failures.

| # | Command | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| 1 kernels | `python -c "import fla, causal_conv1d, deep_ep, transformer_engine"` | no ImportError — a failure here means a silent slow path, not a crash |
| 2 masking | `python examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/affine/check_masking.py --n 8` | exactly **1** supervised run per row, decoding to the final assistant message, generation-prompt `<think>` prefix excluded (§3). Checks **both** paths: `collate=ok packed=ok` per row — the packed column exercises `last_turn_label_hook`, which is what masks a packed run. On v4, supervised counts p50 ≈ 163, p90 ≈ 844, max ≈ 1,801 — thousands per row means the wrapper is inert |
| 3 pre-filter | `python examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/affine/prefilter.py --max-seq-len 40960 --out data/<corpus>_filtered` | the keep rate in §4. A different one means the tokenizer or template changed |
| 4 config parse | `load_yaml_config(<config>)` | no `TypeError: Unexpected ... field(s)`. The VLM `dataloader` allowlist is `{shuffle, num_workers, pin_memory, persistent_workers, prefetch_factor, drop_last}` + `collate_fn`/`_target_` — deliberately **no `batch_size`** (it comes from `step_scheduler.local_batch_size`) |
| 5 tiny proxy | `torchrun --nproc-per-node=2 -m nemo_automodel.recipes.llm.train_ft -c tests/functional_tests/parallelism/qwen3_5_moe_proxy.yaml` | 6 steps, finite decreasing loss |
| 6 smoke | `automodel <config> --nproc-per-node 8 --step_scheduler.max_steps 5 --lr_scheduler.lr_warmup_steps 1 --checkpoint.enabled false` | checklist below |
| 7 probe | `--step_scheduler.max_steps 200` | loss trends down; kill at ~150 and resume via `checkpoint.restore_from`, curve rejoins |
| 8 full run | no overrides | watch `checkpoints/<name>/training.jsonl` |
| 9 export | §10 | base-identical export loads and generates |

Any run shorter than the recipe's warmup **must** pass `--lr_scheduler.lr_warmup_steps 1`
(or `--lr_scheduler.lr_decay_steps N`): `lr_decay_steps` defaults to the step count and
`OptimizerParamScheduler` asserts `lr_warmup_steps < lr_decay_steps`
(`components/optim/scheduler.py:100`), so `max_steps 5` alone fails at setup *after* the
model has loaded.

Rung 6 checklist — check **all**:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| DeepEP engaged | `grep "Falling back to standard GroupedExperts" smoke.log` finds nothing (`moe/layers.py:783`) |
| Backend survived validation | logged `backend.experts == "te"`, `dispatcher == "deepep"` |
| **Weights actually loaded** | step-0 loss ≈ **0.8–1.8**. ≈ **12.4** is `ln(248320)` = random init, i.e. the state-dict adapter matched nothing |
| Masking survived | `num_label_tokens` > 0 and stable |
| Memory | judge by `nvidia-smi`, not `torch` (§9) |

Routing health via `moe_metrics` does **not** work here: it is read only by
`recipes/llm/train_ft.py`, not the VLM recipe, and only logs to W&B.

---

## 8. Failures and fixes

### 8.1 DeepEP internode dispatch: Xid 31, then `timeout (dispatch CPU)`
Every GPU on both nodes logs `Xid 31 ... MMU Fault ... faulted @ 0x0` in the first MoE
layer, then `RuntimeError: DeepEP error: timeout (dispatch CPU)`. NCCL, `ibv_rc_pingpong`
and intra-node DeepEP all pass. Cause: the image's DeepEP (`4214430`, hybrid-ep branch)
predates [DeepEP PR #564](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP/pull/564), which fixes the
RC-QP layout and device-state RDC for NVSHMEM ≥ 3.5 (the image ships 3.6.5); same defect
as NVIDIA-NeMo/RL #4027, and even hybrid-ep HEAD lacks it. Fix: the backport in
`deepep564/` (#564's `configs.cuh` + `ibgda_device.cuh` onto the hybrid-ep tree, plus
`docker/common/deepep.patch` for the CCCL include path, without which the build fails on
`fatal error: cuda/std/tuple`). After it, the 16-rank comms check passes (8192-token
dispatch+combine: 3.2 ms).

### 8.2 `torch.optim.AdamW`: mixed Tensor/DTensor in `_foreach_mul_`
At `ep_size == world_size` the `experts: te` weights are plain tensors while everything
else is FSDP-sharded. Fix: `optimizer.foreach: false`. Moot under `torchao.optim.AdamW8bit`.

### 8.3 `torchao.optim.AdamW8bit` needs torchao 0.14.0
0.17.0 fails on FSDP2 DTensor params inside the compiled step (`aten.view.dtype`
unimplemented; a different failure under `force_eager`). 0.14.0 matches `torch.optim.AdamW`
to 3.4e-3 relative over 3 steps. Pinned with `pip install --no-deps torchao==0.14.0`; its
"Skipping import of cpp extensions" warning is harmless.

The 8-bit optimizer is the memory win: block-wise quantized moments ≈ 8.7 GiB/GPU at EP8
on 8 GPUs vs ~17.4 GiB for bf16 moments. It needed one framework fix — torchao keeps `lr`
as a tensor and raises `RuntimeError: lr was changed to a non-Tensor object` when a
scheduler assigns a float, so `OptimizerParamScheduler.step` now updates a tensor `lr` in
place with `fill_()`. DCP save/load round-trips the quantized state bit-identically.

### 8.4 `CUDA driver error: invalid argument` from the static Triton launcher
The 8 ranks of a node share one container and one `/tmp/torchinductor_root`; concurrent
compiles corrupt kernels another rank then loads (reproduced 2/2 shared, 0/2 per-rank).
Fix: the launcher sets `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/torchinductor_rank${LOCAL_RANK}`.

### 8.5 Length-grouped batching is slow until the Triton cache is warm
The first 100-step run averaged 21 s/step against an expected 8, bimodal (4 s and 31 s for
same-sized batches). `py-spy` found 12–13% of wall time in **Triton autotune benchmarks**
for FLA's `l2norm_fwd` / `layer_norm_gated_fwd`: their autotune keys include a
batch-length term, length grouping gives every step a new length, and each new key costs
~30 s on the rank that hits it — which stalls all ranks at the next collective. Ruled out
first, with measurements: cross-rank batch misalignment (<0.5%), the dataloader, the
optimizer (2.6%). Fix: a **shared, persistent** Triton cache (`/mnt/fast/triton_cache`
bind-mounted, `TRITON_CACHE_DIR=/triton_cache`) while the inductor cache stays per rank —
the race is in inductor's, not Triton's. The first epoch after any change in batch shape
still pays ~25 stalls (~12 min); after that they are gone. **Judge speed only from a warm
run.**

The packed recipe should not have this problem at all: every pack is exactly
`collate_max_length` long, so the batch-length term in the autotune key is constant.
If a packed run still shows the bimodal step times, the fixed-shape assumption is
broken somewhere — check that `collate_max_length` is set, not just `pack_size`.

### 8.6 Smaller items
- `global_batch_size` must be a multiple of `local_batch_size × world_size`
  (`step_scheduler.py:117`): on 16 GPUs lbs 4 → gbs 64, lbs 2 → 32; on 32 GPUs lbs 4 → 128.
- **Killing a run needs SIGKILL.** Ranks re-parent to PID 1 and hold ~100 GB through
  SIGTERM; the next launch then dies on `EADDRINUSE` (29500) while the memory sampler
  silently records the *previous* run's peak. Drain to <2000 MiB first —
  `teardown.sh` does this and waits.
- **A failed rank does not end the run**: survivors block in a collective holding all
  their memory until the 120-minute NCCL timeout. `oom_watchdog.sh` tails every
  node's log and tears down immediately.
- `save_consolidated: final` logs `v4_compatible=False`; a transformers-v4 load needs
  `--checkpoint.v4_compatible=True`.
- **Suspect the hardware before the config** when a run dies with
  `Invalid access of peer GPU memory over nvlink or a hardware error`. One B300 box failed
  mid-session with all NVLinks down and pending uncorrectable retirements on GPU 0. Triage:
  `nvidia-smi -q -d ECC,ROW_REMAPPER | grep -iE 'pending|uncorrectable'` (expect none),
  `nvidia-smi nvlink -s` (links active on every GPU), then DeepEP's
  `tests/test_intranode.py`. A node with pending repairs risks silent corruption over a
  multi-day run — get it reset or replaced.

---

## 9. Measurements

**Read throughput correctly.** `tps` in the log is sequence positions/s summed over all
ranks *including interior padding*; `num_label_tokens` is supervised tokens only. `tps` is
comparable only between runs on the same data (longer rows amortize the fixed per-step
cost: the same config reads ~48k tok/s on a 40k-row corpus and ~22k on the real one) and
it **understates length grouping**, whose whole benefit is removing padding. **Use s/step**
— every step consumes exactly `global_batch_size` samples however they are batched.

`nvidia-smi` runs ~20–30 GiB above `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated` (NCCL/DeepEP buffers,
cuDNN/cuBLAS workspaces, CUDA context), none of it reclaimable — **judge headroom by smi.**

### 9.1 Single node, 8 × H200 (v4, 50 steps each, gbs 32, EP8)

| lbs | batching | AC | s/step | samp/s | label tok/s | torch peak | smi peak | val @49 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | length-grouped | full | **8.01** | 3.99 | 1,242 | 106.4 GiB | 131.3 GiB | 0.5759 |
| 2 | length-grouped | full | 9.79 | 3.27 | 1,073 | 75.3 GiB | 88.8 GiB | 0.5718 |
| **2** | **random** | **full** | **16.62** | 1.92 | 604 | 72.4 GiB | 86.9 GiB | **0.5605** |
| 4 | random | full | 18.97 | 1.69 | 529 | 105.4 GiB | 122.2 GiB | 0.5603 |
| 2 | random | selective | 16.2 † | — | — | 112.5 GiB | 130.4 GiB | — |

† stopped at step 25. The bold row is the single-node default.

- **lbs 2 beats 1** (16.62 vs 19.53 s/step, same val loss) and, with random batching,
  beats 4 — the collator pads to the longest sample in each micro-batch, so padding to the
  longest of four costs more than the larger batch gains. Padding factor vs lbs 1:
  1.47× at lbs 2, 1.95× at 4, 2.37× at 8.
- **Full AC over `selective`** (there is no intermediate rung): selective bought 2.4% for
  **+40 GiB** and reached 139.6 of 140.4 GiB on worst-case batches.
  `activation_checkpointing_scope` does not help — the vision tower is frozen and already
  skipped.
- Worst case, `longest256.parquet` (256 rows of 38.8–40.9k tokens, every batch worst case):
  lbs 2 random 96.9 GiB smi (comfortable); lbs 4 random 138.7 GiB (98.8%); lbs 4 grouped
  139.5 GiB (99.4%); lbs 2 selective 139.6 GiB; lbs 4 selective **OOM**. With random
  batching the smi footprint climbs toward the ceiling over steps; with grouping it is
  pinned there from step 1, because the sampler places the longest rows together by
  construction rather than by luck.
- Gradient clipping at `max_norm: 1.0` fires on **every step of every arm** — the clip, not
  the schedule, sets the effective step size.
- Checkpointing and validation work at lbs 4: sharded save ~80 GB in ~64 s, consolidated
  export 26 shards / ~67 GiB; validation adds no memory beyond the training peak.

Reproducing either arm on one node:

```bash

**Knobs already ruled out, so they need no re-investigation:** fused RoPE (force-disabled
globally, upstream #3027), `compile_attn` (needs `attn: sdpa` + `linear: torch`), CUDA
graphs (sequence lengths vary per micro-batch), the `rms_norm` backend (this model
hard-codes `Qwen3NextRMSNorm`). Still unmeasured: `defer_fsdp_grad_sync`, `experts`
`gmm`/`torch_mm`, `hybridep`, async dispatch, `dispatcher_num_sms`.

### 9.2 Two nodes, 16 × H200 (v4, length-grouped, AdamW8bit, full AC)

| mesh | lbs / gbs | warm s/step | samples/s | val @99 | smi peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EP16 | 4 / 64 | ~14–15 | 4.3 | 0.5132 | 132.6 GiB (95%) |
| EP8 | 2 / 32 | 6.5 | 4.9 | 0.5267 | 77 GiB (55%) |
| **EP8** | **4 / 64** | **7.1** | **9.0** | **0.5135** | **123.7 GiB (88%)** |
| EP16 | 8 / 128 | — | — | — | **OOM on step 0** |

- **Two nodes scale better than linearly with EP8** — 9.0 vs 4.0 samples/s (2.3×).
  Sharding dense params, grads and 8-bit state 16 ways instead of 8 frees the memory lbs 4
  needs, and each node's expert traffic stays on NVLink. What crosses the fabric is the
  dense all-gathers and the expert-grad all-reduce, each well under 0.2 s at 3.3 Tbps.
- **EP16 buys nothing here.** Expert parallelism across nodes only pays when the experts
  don't fit in one node; they do (77 GiB at lbs 2). EP16 just puts half of every
  dispatch/combine on RoCE — `py-spy` shows 22% of forward time in `internode_dispatch`.
- Validation loss is identical across EP8/EP16 at matched batch, as it should be.
- grad_norm 1.6–12.5 against the 1.0 clip, so the 2-node config halves peak LR to 5e-6.
  This is a judgement, not an A/B. (The later v6 runs from base use 5e-5 with a WSD
  schedule instead.)
- **To go faster, add nodes:** with EP8 the expert all-to-all never leaves a node, so
  4 nodes at gbs 128 is near-linear (~18 samples/s, ~1.4 h/epoch on v4). The v5/v6 configs
  do exactly this: 32 GPUs, `ep_size: 8`, MoE mesh `(ep_shard=4, ep=8)`, lbs 4 / gbs 128.
- What will not help: lbs 8 (OOM), selective AC, larger gbs via gradient accumulation.
  (Sequence packing was listed here as incompatible with TE. That is no longer true —
  see §13.5 and `qwen3_6_35b_4node_ep8_packed.yaml`.)

### 9.3 End-to-end 266-step run (2 nodes, EP8, lbs 4, checkpointing + validation live)

| steps | mean loss | grad_norm | s/step | torch peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0–49 | 0.830 | 5.2 | 8.6 | 94 GiB |
| 50–99 | 0.655 | 2.4 | 9.0 | 83 GiB |
| 100–149 | 0.633 | 2.8 (one spike 18.3) | 9.9 | 90 GiB |
| 150–199 | 0.604 | 2.4 | 9.6 | 88 GiB |
| 200–266 | ~0.58 | 2.3 | 9.3 | 50 GiB |

Validation 0.5567 @99 → 0.5318 @199; smi peak 112.7 GiB. Autotune stalls still cost ~25%
of wall time (~14 per 50 steps); excluding them, 6.4–7 s/step. Checkpoint at step 199:
~30 s save, ~75 s pause including validation; 16 model safetensors (67 GiB, all 1,045
tensors), 16 optimizer DCP shards (13 GB), dataloader/rng/scheduler, `LATEST` and
`LOWEST_VAL` symlinks.

**The checkpoint bug this run found:** with `moe.reshard_after_forward: false` (the
single-node value) the step-200 save died with `KeyError: 11` inside DCP's
`get_optimizer_state_dict` — model shards written, optimizer not. At `ep_size 8` on 16
GPUs the experts are FSDP-sharded over the `ep_shard` mesh, FSDP2 reshards only in the
post-backward hook, so the forward-only validation that precedes each save leaves the
expert params unsharded and DCP's identity mapping fails on the first expert weight. The
single-node recipe never sees it (at `ep_size == world_size` the experts are not
FSDP-wrapped). **Set `moe.reshard_after_forward: true` on multi-node**; it costs no
throughput and lowers peak memory 124 → 113 GiB (and ~97 GiB smi at 32 GPUs on v5_130k).

---

## 10. Export (requirement 3)

The stock consolidation (`checkpoint.save_consolidated: final`) merges weights correctly
but is **not** a drop-in for the base: 60 tensors stay fp32 (`A_log`, `dt_bias` in the 30
GDN layers, marked "intrinsically fp32" in `.hf_metadata`, so even `CAST_DTYPE=bf16`
leaves them); `config.json`, `generation_config.json` and the tokenizer files are
re-serialized from the runtime config (`use_cache: false`, `output_hidden_states: true`,
renamed vision `model_type`, dropped sampling defaults); and `preprocessor_config.json`,
`video_preprocessor_config.json`, `vocab.json`, `merges.txt` are never written.

```bash
bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/export_hf.sh <ckpt>/model <out>   # ~40 s
python examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/affine/check_export.py <out>              # rung 9
```

The export script remaps those 60 entries to bf16, consolidates with `--cast-dtype bf16`,
overlays the base snapshot's metadata files, fixes the index `total_size`, and asserts
name/shape/dtype parity for all 1,045 tensors plus byte equality of `config.json`,
`generation_config.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`.

`affine/check_export.py` loads the result with plain `transformers`
(`Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`, 35.107 B params), verifies the 333 frozen vision
tensors are bit-identical to the base, verifies trained tensors differ (after 200 steps
max |Δ| ≈ 5e-4), and generates. Expected layout: **1,045 tensors** — 692
`model.language_model.*`, 333 `model.visual.*`, 19 `mtp.*`, 1 `lm_head.weight`. The HF
class has no MTP module, so `state_dict()` reports 1,026 and the 19 `mtp.*` are ignored on
load, exactly as with the base. (`A_log` shows no change after 200 steps: its fp32 updates
are below bf16 resolution.)

## 11. Running multi-node

Cluster shape this was built for: 4 × GCP `a3-ultragpu-8g` Spot (8 × H200, 224 vCPUs,
32 local NVMe, 2 gVNICs + 8 RoCE NICs `gpu{0..7}rdma0` / `rocep*s0`, MTU 8896), same zone,
one shared SSH account.

**The hosts are Spot and are re-provisioned; nothing below is a permanent address.** After
every re-provisioning, update `NODE_IPS` in `launch_cluster.sh`, the same list in
`teardown.sh`, the SSH user in both, and the `MASTER_ADDR` default in `launch_node.sh`.
The structure is what is stable:

- **torchrun rank order is the order of `NODE_IPS`, which is not the hosts' own numbering.**
  Read that array, don't assume host *N* is rank *N*.
- Rank 0 is the rendezvous master (`MASTER_ADDR`, port 29500) and the NFS server, and is
  where `launch_cluster.sh` and the watchdog run.
- `NNODES=2` means the first two entries of `NODE_IPS`.
- Hosts not in the run may belong to someone else — `teardown.sh` SSHes **every** entry in
  `NODE_IPS` and `pkill -9`s `torchrun` there, so a teardown during a 2-node job kills
  whatever the other hosts are running. Trim the array before using it that way.

> **Never `apt install` on a node of a live run.** On 2026-09-15 `sudo apt install gh` on
> rank 0 let needrestart restart `systemd-networkd`, `rdma-ndd` and the guest agent; ~60 s
> later every rank died with `ncclRemoteError` at step 2,344 of the v5_130k run and the
> 120-minute NCCL timeout held all 32 GPUs. Install tools on the laptop, or wait for a
> checkpoint boundary; if unavoidable, `sudo NEEDRESTART_MODE=l apt install ...`.

Per-node storage: the 32 local SSDs are one RAID0 at `/mnt/fast` — **not in `/etc/fstab`**,
so after a reboot re-assemble (`mdadm --assemble --scan`) and re-mount; spot preemption
wipes the array outright, along with the image, data, Triton cache and checkpoints, and it
has to be rebuilt:

```bash
apt-get install -y docker.io nvidia-container-toolkit mdadm nfs-common ibverbs-utils
nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && systemctl restart docker
DEVS=$(lsblk -dn -b -o NAME,SIZE | awk '$2 == 402653184000 {print "/dev/"$1}')
mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=32 $DEVS --run
mkfs.ext4 -F -m 0 -E lazy_itable_init=1,lazy_journal_init=1 /dev/md0
mkdir -p /mnt/fast && mount -o noatime /dev/md0 /mnt/fast
# then: docker data-root -> /mnt/fast/docker, rebuild the deepep564 image, restore /mnt/fast/hf
```

`/mnt/fast/hf` is
`HF_HOME` (local per node); rank 0 exports `/mnt/fast/shared` over NFS (`nconnect=16`)
holding the checkout, `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, `checkpoints/` — so the recipe's relative
paths resolve identically on every node, which DCP needs (each rank writes its own shards,
rank 0 consolidates by reading all of them). Docker's data root is on `/mnt/fast` too
(46 GB image). Hugging Face has rate-limited one host's public IP (HTTP 429) even with a
token, while the others were fine: if that happens, download on a host that works and copy
over NFS. The launcher sets `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`.

```bash
# 2 nodes: rank 0 first, from the checkout on the NFS share
bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/launch_node.sh 0 [--key.sub value ...]
bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/launch_node.sh 1 [--key.sub value ...]

# 4 nodes: NNODES=4 per node, or fan out over SSH from rank 0's node
bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/launch_cluster.sh [--key.sub value ...]

# 16-rank NCCL + DeepEP smoke test (pass = COMM_CHECK_PASS on rank 0)
ENTRY=examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/affine/comm_check.py bash ...launch_node.sh 0

# worst-case memory probe
bash ... 0 --step_scheduler.max_steps 5 --lr_scheduler.lr_warmup_steps 1 \
  --checkpoint.enabled false --dataset.path_or_dataset data/v4_88k_longest/train.parquet
```

The launcher runs `torchrun` inside the container, tees rank 0 to
`logs/<timestamp>_node<rank>.log`, and takes recipe overrides after the node rank. Knobs:
`IMAGE`, `CONFIG`, `RUN_NAME`, `MASTER_ADDR`, `MASTER_PORT`, `NNODES`, `TORCHRUN_ARGS`,
`ENTRY`, `NCCL_DEBUG`, `NVSHMEM_DEBUG`, `TRITON_PRINT_AUTOTUNING`. It sets Google's gIB
NCCL plugin (`/usr/local/gib/scripts/set_nccl_env.sh`),
`NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=...=enp0s19`, `NVSHMEM_IB_GID_INDEX=3` (RoCE v2), per-rank
`NVSHMEM_HCA_LIST=gpu{N}rdma0` so each GPU uses its own rail, and
`--privileged --network host --ipc host --ulimit memlock=-1`.

**Always sample `nvidia-smi` alongside the run**
(`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,memory.used --format=csv,noheader,nounits -l 2 > memlog.csv`);
`launch_cluster.sh` does it for you on every node, into `logs/<RUN_NAME>-<stamp>/`.

Watchdog and teardown, for any run left unattended:

```bash
# in a second shell on rank 0, after the run dir exists
RUN_NAME=<name> FINAL_STEP=<last step> bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/oom_watchdog.sh

# tearing down by hand: kill the watchdog first, or it fires on the way down
pkill -f "[o]om_watchdog"
RUN_NAME=<name> bash examples/vlm_finetune/qwen3_5_moe/teardown.sh
```

`RUN_NAME` must match the launch (it names the containers `<RUN_NAME>_node<rank>` and the
run dir); `FINAL_STEP` is the last optimizer step, which is how the watchdog tells a
finished run from a dead one. Note that `pkill -f <pattern>` run over `ssh` matches its own
remote shell — hence the `[o]` bracket in every pattern in these scripts.

Syncing the checkout to the nodes is normally `git pull` on the NFS share. From the Windows
checkout use `git -c core.autocrlf=false archive HEAD | ssh ... tar -x`; a plain archive,
`tar` or `scp` carries CRLF, which breaks the launchers and YAMLs confusingly. Keep the
scripts mode 664 on the node (they are committed 100644) or git reports mode changes.

> The cluster account is shared. Other sessions have installed packages under
> `/mnt/fast/shared` and once deleted `/mnt/fast/hf/hub` (67 GB of base weights) with no
> `sudo` and no log. Keep a second copy of anything you cannot re-download.

## 12. If it OOMs

In this order, re-running rung 6 after each: lower the pre-filter cap to 32,768 and
re-filter (still ~96.6% of v4 rows) · `--distributed.cp_size 2` with
`--step_scheduler.global_batch_size 16` (dp4/cp2 keeps `dp_size * cp_size = 8`, so
`ep_size: 8` stays legal) · `--distributed.moe.reshard_after_forward true` ·
confirm `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`.

Fixed memory per GPU at EP8 on 8 GPUs: params 8.8 + grads 8.7 + AdamW8bit moments ≈ 8.7
GiB, plus activations, against 141 GiB. Halve the fixed part for each doubling of the
world size; on 2 GPUs (EP2) multiply it by 4.

---

## 13. Open questions

1. **Resume from a multi-node checkpoint** (`checkpoint.restore_from`, or the `LATEST`
   symlink) has never been exercised end to end. Note that resuming an `AdamW8bit` run
   needs commit `3e0ed2695` ("restore DTensor specs of torchao quantized optimizer state
   on load") — without it the first step after a resume dies in `lerp`. On Spot hosts this
   is the difference between a preemption costing an hour and costing the run, so it is
   worth a deliberate kill-and-resume test rather than discovering it during a preemption.
2. **The LR** is a judgement everywhere, not an A/B: clipping fires every step at 1e-5 in
   every configuration measured, the 2-node v4 config dropped to 5e-6, and the v6 runs
   from base use 5e-5 with a WSD schedule.
3. **Length-grouped vs random — resolved by dropping the sampler.** Grouping is 1.70×
   faster but showed a consistently worse validation loss (0.5718 vs 0.5605) over 50 steps
   of a single seed, entirely inside LR warmup — weak evidence either way. The bias is
   worse than first recorded: `LengthGroupedSampler` sorts the dataset **once** in
   `__init__` (`length_grouped_sampler.py:116`) and `set_epoch` never re-sorts, so the
   per-epoch chunk shuffle only reorders batches — **batch membership is frozen for the
   entire run, across every epoch and every restart.** The packed recipe drops the sampler
   entirely: packs are all `collate_max_length` long, so there is no padding left for
   grouping to remove. It stays enabled in the unpacked multi-node recipe, where removing
   it would cost the 1.70× for nothing.

   Two things to know when removing it: the fallback `DistributedSampler` is constructed
   without `seed` (`vlm/loader.py:409`), so data order stops honouring `seed: 1234`; and
   the saved `dataloader/dataloader_dp_rank_*.pt` carries `{yielded, epoch}` that a
   `DistributedSampler` cannot consume, with no compatibility gate on restore (the check
   at `base_recipe.py:511` inspects only the model config). **Start a packed run in a
   fresh `checkpoint_dir`.** `affine/check_sampler.py` documents the frozen-membership
   behaviour and is dead once the sampler is gone.
4. **Signal density.** 2.8% of processed tokens are supervised (§4). Collapsing to the
   unique full trajectories and supervising every turn would give equivalent coverage for
   ~a ninth of the compute. The user has been told and chose the current design; do not
   change it unilaterally.
5. **Sequence packing — implemented and measured on 2 × B300 (2026-09-21). Not yet run on 4 nodes.**
   `qwen3_6_35b_4node_ep8_packed.yaml` is `neat` packing with `attn: te` and no
   length-grouped sampler. The earlier rejection rested on three claims, two of them wrong:

   - *"The 30 GDN layers treat a whole pack as one sequence and bleed silently."*
     **Stale.** Upstream `c4a4c8322` threads `cu_seqlens` + `seq_idx` and unpads to
     `[1, total_valid, H]` (`cp_linear_attn.py:206-345`), reporting a standalone-vs-packed
     layer diff of `4.011e-01 → 0.000e+00`. GDN packing was correct before this recipe
     existed.
   - *"`neat` + TE passes the document-id mask to TE as a padding mask."* Right
     conclusion, wrong mechanism. At cp1 `neat` materialized a **4-D** mask, which
     `attention/utils.py` reshaped into a 6-D tensor — an error, not a bleed. The genuine
     silent bleed is the 2-D indexed map, reachable only at cp>1.
   - *"`packing_format: thd` emits `seq_lens` but no `attention_mask`."* True, but it
     hard-crashes in GDN (`cp_linear_attn.py:186`) rather than bleeding, so `thd` is
     simply unwired for the MoE model.

   What made it work: the packed collater keeps the compact `[B, S]` document map for
   `te`, as it already did for FlashAttention, instead of expanding the dense
   `[B, 1, S, S]` mask — **1.6 GiB per row at `pack_size` 40,960** — and
   `_Qwen3_5MoeAttention` unpads q/k/v and calls TE in its native `qkv_format="thd"` with
   `cu_seqlens`, reusing the metadata GDN already builds once per forward. TE's fused
   kernel is kept; an `arbitrary` 4-D mask would fall back to the unfused path §6 measures
   at +259 GiB.

   The last-turn masking problem was real and is solved by a new generic `label_post_hook`
   on `PreTokenizedDatasetWrapper` (`packed_sequence.label_post_hook_fn`), which runs
   *after* labels are built, unlike `post_tokenize_hook`. `affine/dataset.py` supplies
   `last_turn_label_hook`; rung 2 now checks it beside the collator path, and both corpus
   cases of §3 were verified against the real tokenizer.

   **Second win confirmed:** pack shapes are fixed at `collate_max_length`, so FLA's
   autotune key stops changing every step. Step times over 50 steps held **11.63–12.7 s**
   with no bimodality, against the 4 s/31 s split §8.5 measured under length grouping. Only
   step 0 is an outlier (52.6 s).

   **Measured, 2 × B300, `ep_size 2`, `lbs 1`, `gbs 2`, `pack_size 40960`, v5_130k:**

   | quantity | value |
   |---|---|
   | packs | 128,575 rows → **14,644 packs, 100.0% estimated utilization** (the committed step counts assumed ~97% fill) |
   | TE backend | `Selected backend = FusedAttention (sub-backend 1)`, `qkv_layout thd_thd_thd`, `head_dim_qk 256`, TE 2.18.0 / cuDNN 9.26.0 / sm103 |
   | step 0 loss | 0.9649 — inside the 0.8–1.8 band, so the state-dict adapter matched |
   | loss trend | first-10 mean 0.9277 → last-10 mean 0.6980 over 50 steps; final validation 0.6695 |
   | `num_label_tokens` | min 1,415, max 10,753, mean **4,692** per step = **5.7%** of the 81,920 tokens processed. An inert label hook would supervise every assistant turn (§4: ~36×), which cannot fit inside 81,920 |
   | memory | `torch` 118.6 GiB steady; **`nvidia-smi` peak 147.6 GiB / 133.5 GiB of 275 GiB** — the EP2-on-2-GPU fixed cost dominates, as predicted |
   | throughput | ~6,800–7,200 tok/s (~3,400–3,600/GPU) |
   | clean | no DeepEP `GroupedExperts` fallback, no `pixel_values`, no 2-D-mask guard, no unfused attention |

   **Cross-document parity (P3) passes, but the original test was not sufficient.**
   Comparing a packed forward against per-document forwards conflates leakage with
   *arithmetic reordering* — grouped-GEMM token grouping and GDN chunk offsets reorder
   accumulation, which changes rounding without moving information. In bf16 that reordering
   reaches 0.125 on a document, above any absolute `atol` worth setting (one bf16 ulp at
   these activation magnitudes is already ~1e-2), so the check reported benign drift as a
   leak. `check_packed_parity.py --perturb-neighbors` is now the authoritative test: it holds
   every length and offset fixed and replaces only the *content* of the other documents, so
   any difference at all is leakage. Result: **0.000e+00, bitwise, for every document in both
   backends and both dtypes.** fp32 packed-vs-solo also passes (1.1e-05 / 6.6e-06 / 9.8e-06),
   and bisecting `--layers` clears the GDN half and the attention half independently. Treat
   fp32 as the gate and read bf16 drift as informational.

   **The 6-D mask question is answered: TE raises, it does not bleed.** A 2-D
   `[batch, sequence]` padding mask returns normally, while both the 4-D block-causal mask
   and the 6-D tensor the old code produced raise `RuntimeError: Tensors must have same
   number of dimensions`. So anyone who switched the upstream `neat` recipes
   (`qwen3_5_4b_neat_packing.yaml`, `qwen3_5_35b_neat_packing.yaml`) to `attn: te` got a
   crash, not silent cross-document attention. The 2-D indexed-map bleed of §2 is unaffected,
   since a 2-D mask *is* accepted.

   **Two implementation bugs only a GPU could find**, both now pinned by tests in
   `test_qwen3_5_moe_packed_te_attention.py`:

   - `cu_seqlens` was built int64. TE asserts int32
     (`dot_product_attention.py:1359`). Converted at the TE call site, not in the shared
     packed metadata, because FLA's `chunk_gated_delta_rule` takes a `LongTensor`.
   - The repad assumed a 3-D attention output. TE returns `[tokens, heads * head_dim]` for
     `qkv_format="thd"`, so `attn_output.shape[2]` raised `IndexError`. Trailing dimensions
     are now carried through rather than assumed.

   **MTP needed a separate fix, in the loss.** `calculate_mtp_loss` masks depth-k targets
   whose rolled source crosses a document boundary, but only when it is given `cu_seqlens`
   **or** `seq_idx`. Both recipes passed `batch.get("cu_seqlens")` only — written for THD
   packing, where that key exists. `neat` emits no `cu_seqlens`, so the guard silently
   no-opped and **every depth-k target at a document's last k tokens was rolled in from the
   next document.** Fixed by also passing `seq_idx=batch.get("_packed_seq_ids")` (the
   indexed map `neat` already produces) in both `recipes/vlm/finetune.py` and
   `recipes/llm/train_ft.py`. Covered by
   `tests/unit_tests/loss/test_mtp_packed_seq_idx.py`, whose first test pins the old
   leak. `mtp_loss_scaling_factor: 0.1` itself was never broken — it resolves correctly
   from the model output when no `mtp.scaling_factor` is set.

   With that in place the MTP per-depth **position ids**, which are still rolled without
   regard to boundaries, no longer matter: the only positions with a wrong position id are
   the last k tokens of each document, and those now have a masked target, a zero-filled
   source embedding, and — because the MTP sublayers receive the same document map and run
   the same per-document TE route — no causal influence on any unmasked position. This is
   reasoning, not a measurement; if MTP loss ever looks wrong on a packed run, check it.

   **Unverified, needs the container:** whether TE raises or silently accepts the
   malformed 6-D mask (if it accepts, the two shipped upstream `neat` recipes are bleeding
   today); the `chunk_gated_delta_rule` signature in the installed FLA 0.4.2; and the run
   end to end. `PACKING_BRINGUP.md` is the ordered procedure for settling all three on a
   2-GPU box.
6. **FP8.** `te_fp8` works on Hopper elsewhere in this repo and is the next large speedup.
   No fp8 reference exists for this model family — an experiment after a green bf16
   baseline, not a default.

## 14. Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qwen3_6_35b_1node_ep8.yaml` | single-node 8×H200 recipe (EP8, lbs 2, random batching) |
| `qwen3_6_35b_ddp2.yaml` | pure-DDP 2-GPU variant (`ep_size: 1`, `dispatcher: torch`) — probe only; each rank materializes the whole model on CPU first (~13 min, single-threaded) and the fit was never confirmed |
| `qwen3_6_35b_4node_ep8_base.yaml` | 4-node run from the base model on v6_137k (5 epochs, WSD, peak LR 5e-5) |
| `qwen3_6_35b_4node_ep8_packed.yaml` | the same run with `neat` packing + TE and no length-grouped sampler (§13.5). Step counts are derived from an estimated pack count and **must** be recomputed from the packer's log before a full run |
| `affine/dataset.py` | dataset adapter (`make_affine_dataset`) + `last_turn_collate_fn` (unpacked) and `last_turn_label_hook` (packed) — the masking, §3 |
| `affine/check_masking.py` | rung 2 |
| `affine/check_export.py` | rung 9 |
| `affine/export_hf_helper.py` | offline consolidation used by `export_hf.sh` |
| `affine/dump_sample.py` | dump one training-ready sample with the supervised span marked |
| `SETUP_2xB300.md` | bare RunPod image → working packed run: every environment error hit on 2026-09-21 and its fix, the version set that came out, memory/speed per batch size, and how not to collide two jobs on one box |
| `PACKING_GPU_FIXES.md` | what broke when packing first ran on a GPU (int32 `cu_seqlens`, 2-D TE `thd` output), why the parity gate had to change (`--perturb-neighbors`), the end-to-end check, the two procedure mistakes, and the measured 2.7–3.8× over the unpacked baseline |
| `b300/` | the provisioning and run scripts the setup doc refers to |
| `affine/check_packed_e2e.py` | per-document CE, real model + real packer, packed vs solo — the floor is document 1 |
| `affine/make_short_subset.py` | short-row corpus for the fast smoke rung; `pack_size` cannot be lowered on the full corpus |
| `PACKING_BRINGUP.md` | how to qualify the packing change on 2 GPUs before a 4-node run: the TE fused-attention gate, the parity test, the smoke checks, and the step-schedule recomputation |
| `affine/check_packed_parity.py` | packed-vs-standalone parity per document — the gate for §13.5 |
| `affine/check_sampler.py` | what `LengthGroupedSampler` actually yields, epoch over epoch — shows the frozen batch membership of §13.3; dead for the packed recipe |
| `affine/find_reasoning_rows.py` | scan a corpus for rows carrying real reasoning (decides which case §3 is in) |
| `affine/sample_rows.py` | row sampler for the subset ablations |
| `affine/comm_check.py` | multi-rank NCCL all-reduce + DeepEP dispatch/combine smoke test |
| `export_hf.sh` | base-identical HF export of a sharded checkpoint (§10) |
| `launch_node.sh` | per-node launcher (container, gIB NCCL, NVSHMEM rails, caches); `NNODES` sets the node count |
| `launch_cluster.sh` | fans that launcher out over SSH and samples `nvidia-smi` |
| `oom_watchdog.sh`, `teardown.sh` | immediate teardown on OOM; drain GPUs and free port 29500 |
| `deepep564/` | patched container: DeepEP PR #564 backport + torchao 0.14 (§5, §8.1) |
| `affine/prefilter.py` | rung 3: the offline length filter and train/val split |
