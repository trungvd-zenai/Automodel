# Train Draft Models for Speculative Decoding in NeMo AutoModel

This directory trains the **draft models** used for speculative decoding. A draft
proposes several future tokens cheaply, the frozen **target** model verifies them
in one forward pass, and every accepted token is a step the target never had to
run autoregressively. The faster and more accurate the draft, the higher the
acceptance length and the larger the inference speedup.

AutoModel trains the draft. You then serve the draft and target together in an
inference engine (SGLang or vLLM). The training code lives in
`nemo_automodel/components/speculative/`, the recipes in
`nemo_automodel/recipes/llm/`, and ready-to-run configs in this folder.

## Supported Methods

| Method | What the Draft Does | Recipe (`recipe:` Key) | Configs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EAGLE-1** | Single decoder block that predicts the next target hidden state. Supervised by SmoothL1 hidden-state loss and a token loss through the frozen target `lm_head`. | `TrainEagle1Recipe` | `eagle1/` |
| **EAGLE-2** | Same training objective as EAGLE-1 (it differs only in the inference-time tree policy), so the recipe is a thin subclass. | `TrainEagle2Recipe` | `eagle2/` |
| **EAGLE-3** | Draft with its own `lm_head` over a (optionally compressed) draft vocab, fed three auxiliary target hidden states, trained with a **test-time-training (TTT)** unroll. | `TrainEagle3Recipe` | `eagle3/` |
| **EAGLE-3.1** | EAGLE-3 with two drafter toggles (`fc_norm`, `norm_output`), matching the vLLM EAGLE-3.1 architecture. | `TrainEagle3Recipe` | `eagle3_1/` |
| **P-EAGLE** | Parallel-drafting EAGLE-3: predicts all `num_depths` tokens in one forward over a COD-subsampled sequence instead of the TTT unroll. Serves on vLLM only. | `TrainEagle3Recipe` (`parallel_drafting: true`) | `p-eagle/` |
| **DFlash** | Block-parallel drafting: drafts a whole block of `block_size` tokens in one non-causal "denoising" forward over `[anchor, MASK, MASK, ...]`. | `TrainDFlashRecipe` (LLM) / `DiffusionLMSFTRecipe` (DLLM SFT) | `dflash/`, `../dllm_sft/*dflash*` |
| **DFlash 2** | DFlash backbone plus a two-tap dynamic convolution around every draft sublayer (kills suffix decay) and a pairwise path selector that walks one coherent path through each position's top-k candidates. | `TrainDFlash2Recipe` | `dflash/qwen3_dflash2.yaml`, `dflash/qwen3_8_27b_dflash2.yaml` |
| **Domino** | DFlash backbone plus a serial GRU correction head (`prefix_gru` / `embed_proj`) that refines each block position on the previous ones. | `TrainDominoRecipe` | `dflash/qwen3_domino.yaml` |
| **JetSpec** | DFlash backbone trained as a *causal* parallel tree drafter: causal in-block attention plus forward-KL distillation against the target distribution. | `TrainJetSpecRecipe` | `jetspec/` |
| **DSpark** | Semi-autoregressive parallel drafting: a parallel backbone drafts the block, a lightweight serial Markov head adds intra-block dependency, and a confidence head predicts per-position acceptance. | `TrainDSparkRecipe` | `dspark/` |

EAGLE-1/2/3 keep their separate code paths: `*_v12.py` files are the **EAGLE-1/2**
("v1/v2") implementation. The unsuffixed files are the EAGLE-3/3.1 path. Inside
EAGLE-3, `fc_norm`/`norm_output` upgrade to 3.1 and `parallel_drafting` upgrades
to P-EAGLE, all from the same draft class. Domino and JetSpec reuse the DFlash
draft class and checkpoint format. Only their training wrappers (and, for
Domino, the extra head weights) differ. DFlash 2 keeps the same block-drafting
contract but adds parameters inside the stack, so it has its own draft class
(`Qwen3DFlash2DraftModel`) whose checkpoint layout matches the published DFlash 2
drafters.

**Not yet runnable: MSD (multimodal speculative decoding).** `eagle/msd.py`,
`msd_target.py`, `msd_curriculum.py`, and `msd_decode.py` implement the MSD
training core, the frozen VLM target wrapper, the two-stage data curriculum, and
the reference tree-decoding path. MSD extends EAGLE-1/2 feature drafting to
vision-language targets: text positions keep the usual concatenation of target
features and next-token embeddings, while image positions feed the target's
already-projected image embeddings straight into the draft. It is deliberately
absent from the table above because no recipe or config wires it up yet, so there
is nothing to launch. The recipe and data pipeline are a follow-up change.

## Supported Target Models

A target's `config.architectures` string selects the draft architecture through a
registry (`eagle/registry.py`, `dflash/registry.py`, `dspark/registry.py`).
Capability is per registry, not per (method, target) pair: the EAGLE-3.1
(`fc_norm` / `norm_output`) and P-EAGLE (`parallel_drafting`) toggles ride on the
same EAGLE-3 dense draft, so they apply to any target the EAGLE-3 registry maps.
The shipped example configs only cover a subset.

- **EAGLE-1/2/3 (and the EAGLE-3.1 / P-EAGLE toggles on top of EAGLE-3)**:
  `LlamaForCausalLM`, `Phi3ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`.
- **gpt-oss** (`GptOssForCausalLM`): EAGLE-3 only, using a dedicated draft class.
- **DeepSeek-V3** (`DeepseekV3ForCausalLM`): EAGLE-3 only, using a dedicated MLA
  draft class (eager attention, sequence packing not supported yet).
- **Gemma4** (`Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`): EAGLE-3 only, using a dedicated
  draft class that reconciles the Gemma4 text config (`hidden_activation`, nested
  per-attention-type `rope_parameters`). The target is multimodal but the draft is
  trained on its **text backbone only**: the decoder config is read through
  `config.get_text_config()` and the draft consumes post-block hidden states, so
  images do not participate in drafting. Configs: `eagle3/gemma4_e2b_eagle3.yaml`,
  `gemma4_e4b_eagle3.yaml`, `gemma4_31b_eagle3.yaml`, `gemma4_26b_a4b_eagle3.yaml`.
- **Kimi K3** (`KimiK3ForCausalLM`, `KimiK3ForConditionalGeneration`): EAGLE-3,
  using a dedicated NoPE-MLA draft class (eager attention, no context or
  tensor parallelism and no sequence packing, see
  `eagle3/README_kimi_k3.md`).
- **DFlash / DFlash 2 / Domino / JetSpec**: `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`,
  `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`, `Qwen3_5MoeForCausalLM`,
  `Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration` (the Qwen3.5 family, which `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`
  belongs to; its decoder config is read from the nested `text_config`). All
  DFlash-family recipes reject `distributed.pp_size > 1`: online hidden-state
  capture hooks one complete, non-pipelined target forward.
- **DFlash on Kimi K3** (`KimiK3ForCausalLM`, `KimiK3ForConditionalGeneration`):
  using a dedicated dense MLA draft class. Plain DFlash only (Domino's projector
  head is Qwen3-only, and there is no DFlash 2 draft for it), and it requires
  `attention_backend: sdpa`. Sequence packing and context parallelism are
  rejected, because K3 owns both itself. See `dflash/README_kimi_k3.md`.
- **DSpark**: `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3MoeForCausalLM`,
  `DeepseekV4ForCausalLM`, GLM-5.2 (`GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM`), Gemma4
  (`Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`, `Gemma4UnifiedForConditionalGeneration`),
  and MiniMax M3 VL (`MiniMaxM3SparseForConditionalGeneration`, including a
  multimodal data path through `recipe_args.multimodal: true`).

Qwen3-MoE is handled exactly like a dense target: the draft only consumes
post-block hidden states, never per-expert routing. gpt-oss uses a dedicated
draft class that reuses the target's YaRN rotary embedding but keeps the on-disk
`architectures` string as the Llama EAGLE-3 draft so inference engines load it
unchanged. The large-MoE DSpark targets (DeepSeek-V4, GLM-5.2, MiniMax M3) load
frozen through the same expert-parallel / FSDP paths their fine-tuning recipes use.
Per-target notes are in `dspark/README_*.md`.

## Quickstart

The CLI is `automodel` (alias `am`). It drives `torchrun` internally.

Train an EAGLE-3 draft model:

```bash
automodel examples/speculative/eagle3/llama_eagle3_mvp.yaml --nproc-per-node 8
```

Override any config key inline:

```bash
automodel examples/speculative/eagle3/llama_eagle3_perfectblend.yaml --nproc-per-node 8 --recipe_args.micro_batch_size=2
```

Run DFlash **DLLM SFT** configs under `../dllm_sft/` with the standard AutoModel
SFT entry script:

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 examples/dllm_sft/finetune.py -c examples/dllm_sft/qwen3_4b_dflash.yaml
```

Each config family ships an `*_mvp.yaml` (tiny single-GPU smoke with placeholder
data paths) and a `*_perfectblend.yaml` (real run on
`frankleeeee/PerfectBlend-Regenerated-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`).

## Operators, Kernels, and Attention Backends

Beyond the methods themselves, the subsystem supports several compute backends.
Select them in the config. All degrade gracefully when a dependency is missing.

### Draft Attention Backend

| Method | Backends | How to Select |
|---|---|---|
| EAGLE-3 / 3.1 | `eager`, `flash_attention_2` | `recipe_args.draft_attn_implementation` (default `eager`) |
| EAGLE-1/2 | `eager` only | n/a |
| P-EAGLE | `flex_attention` (compiled when CUDA + head_dim ≥ 16, else eager flex) | automatic |
| DFlash / DFlash 2 / Domino / JetSpec | `flex_attention`, `sdpa` | `recipe_args.attention_backend` (default `flex_attention`) |
| DSpark | `flex_attention` (Qwen3 / Gemma4 / MiniMax M3 drafts), `sdpa` (V4 / GLM MLA drafts, fixed) | `recipe_args.attention_backend` |

For EAGLE-3, FlashAttention-2 is real FA2 over the TTT attention pattern: FA2
computes the `T×T` causal block and returns `softmax_lse`, and the diagonal
extension columns for cached TTT steps are merged in log space through `logaddexp`.
The draft declares `_supports_flash_attn = True`, FA2 availability is probed
defensively (`_HAS_FA`), and requesting `flash_attention_2` without `flash-attn`
installed raises rather than silently falling back. A ready example is
`eagle3/llama_eagle3_mvp_flash_attn.yaml`. FA2 requires a right-padded attention
mask (enforced at runtime).

### Fused Triton Soft Cross-Entropy

EAGLE-3/P-EAGLE supervise the draft with a masked soft cross-entropy that uses a
**fused Triton kernel** when Triton is available and the logits are on CUDA
(`components/loss/soft_ce.py`, `components/loss/triton/soft_cross_entropy.py`),
falling back to a pure-PyTorch `log_softmax` path otherwise. The masked reduction
normalizes by valid-position count.

### Draft-Vocab Compression (d2t / t2d)

EAGLE-3 can shrink the draft `lm_head` to `draft_vocab_size < target_vocab_size`.
Training carries two tensors: `selected_token_ids` (draft index to target id, the
"d2t" direction) and `selected_token_mask` (a boolean membership mask over the
full target vocab, the "t2d" direction). The mapping is built and cached by
`components/datasets/llm/eagle3.py`. Set `recipe_args.draft_vocab_size` to enable,
or point `recipe_args.selected_token_ids_path` at a precomputed map. `t2d` is
unset when the draft vocab is uncompressed.

### FP8 Draft Training

All spec-decode recipes (EAGLE-1/2, EAGLE-3 / P-EAGLE, DFlash / Domino /
JetSpec, DSpark) accept the same top-level `fp8:` block as the SFT recipes (see
`components/quantization/fp8.py`). When enabled, the draft's `nn.Linear` layers
are swapped to torchao `Float8Linear` before the DDP / FSDP2 wrap, so the
draft's forward and backward GEMMs run in FP8. Requires SM89+ (H100 or newer);
`emulate: true` runs the FP8 numerics on older GPUs for testing. The frozen
target model is never converted (it already supports FP8-quantized checkpoints
through dequant-on-load in the DSpark V4 / GLM path). Linears with a weight dim not
divisible by 16 are skipped automatically. Use `filter_fqns` to exclude more
(for example, `["lm_head"]`). On DSpark's FSDP2 path, `enable_fsdp_float8_all_gather`
and `precompute_float8_dynamic_scale_for_fsdp` reduce the cost of computing
scales at each step. The SFT recipes use the same optimization. See
`eagle3/qwen3_eagle3_fp8.yaml`.

**Pair `fp8:` with `compile:`.** The recipes also accept the SFT recipes'
top-level `compile:` block (`CompileConfig`). The draft is compiled in place
(`nn.Module.compile()`, so checkpoint keys are unchanged) after the FP8 swap.
This matters for FP8 throughput: Float8Linear's per-GEMM cast/scale ops are
memory-bound and only pay off when inductor fuses them into the GEMM
prologue. In eager mode FP8 draft training is typically slower than BF16
(measured 0.76x on an H100 EAGLE-3 run). Compiled, the same A/B measured
FP8 at 1.03x over BF16 with byte-equivalent convergence. Expect the FP8
gain to scale with draft GEMM size: a single 4096-wide EAGLE-3 layer sits
near the float8 break-even point, while wider or deeper drafts (DSpark on
V4/GLM-scale targets) benefit more. `compile:` also works without `fp8:`
as a plain draft speedup (measured ~1.34x over the eager BF16 baseline in
the same run).

### LoRA Draft Adaptation (EAGLE-3 Only)

The EAGLE-3 recipe accepts the SFT recipes' `peft:` block (`PeftConfig`). The
base draft is frozen and only `lora_A`/`lora_B` adapters train. Checkpoints are
adapter-only (`adapter_model.safetensors` through the standard PEFT checkpoint
path). This is for adapting an existing draft to a new domain or dataset:
point `recipe_args.draft_weights_path` at the consolidated safetensors export
of a trained draft to warm-start the base weights (adapters over a randomly
initialized draft are pointless. `draft_weights_path` also works without
`peft:` for full-FT continued training). With a compressed draft vocab the
base run's token mapping must be reused through `selected_token_ids_path` (the
frozen `lm_head` rows are tied to it). A differing mapping fails fast at
load. The final checkpoint of a LoRA run also exports the merged
draft to `model/consolidated` (serve-ready, same layout as full-FT runs), so
no external merge step is needed. Not supported with `parallel_drafting`
(P-EAGLE trains `mask_hidden` and the embeddings, which the LoRA freeze would
lock), with `freeze_embeddings: false` (same freeze conflict), with `fp8:`,
or in the DFlash-family / DSpark / EAGLE-1/2 recipes (rejected explicitly.
Their drafts carry trainable non-LoRA heads that the freeze would silently
lock, and only EAGLE-3 implements the warm start). See
`eagle3/qwen3_eagle3_lora.yaml`.

## Target Backends

The frozen target produces the supervision signal (aux hidden states and the
target distribution). EAGLE-3 supports three ways to run it.

| Backend | `recipe_args.target_model_backend` | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Co-located (default)** | `colocated` | Target and draft share the same GPUs. Simplest, default for every config. |
| **Remote** | `remote` | Target served on separate GPUs/host. Training streams supervision over HTTP (control) and NCCL (data, with a binary wire fallback). Numerically identical to co-located. |
| **Offline cache** | set `cached_target_path` | Precompute target outputs once to disk, then train without the target loaded. Disk-heavy and largely superseded by the remote backend. |

Remote serving (`eagle3/llama_eagle3_remote.yaml`): start a server first, then
point training at it.

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.serve_target --target meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

```yaml
recipe_args:
  target_model_backend: remote
  remote_urls: ["http://localhost:8001"]
  target_prefetch_depth: 1
```

Offline cache is produced by `precompute_eagle3.py`
(`python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.precompute_eagle3 --target-model ... --input-data ... --output-dir ...`),
then consumed through `cached_target_path`. DSpark also supports a text-only offline cache through `precompute_dspark.py`
for HF-loadable single-process text targets.

The loss-mask options live under `recipe_args` in the speculative recipes (not under a
`dataset:` block): `mask_reasoning_content` drops rendered reasoning traces from the loss, and
`mask_generation_prompt` drops the prefix of each assistant turn that the chat template's
generation prompt supplies at inference (the role header and any empty reasoning block such as the
`<think>\n\n</think>\n\n` Qwen3 inserts). Only a generation prompt the template appends to the
unchanged conversation prefix, and that the rendered turn reproduces in full, is removed; anything
else leaves the turn supervised. Both default to `false`. The offline cache stores the loss mask,
so a cache is tied to the options it was produced with: the producer takes the same two flags,
records them in the manifest, and the cached trainer refuses to start when the recipe setting
differs from the manifest. To train with `mask_generation_prompt` on a cache, pass the flag at
both ends.

Both options locate assistant turns by rendering conversation prefixes, like answer-only
masking on a template without `{% generation %}` blocks, so they need a template that renders
earlier turns the same way as the conversation grows. The stock Qwen3 template (`Qwen/Qwen3-8B`)
does not: it drops the `<think>` block from every assistant turn before the last user query, so
a multi-turn sample fails while rendering its first assistant turn, whether or not the flags are
set. With that template keep the data single-turn (PerfectBlend holds 2-72-turn conversations),
or supply a prefix-stable or `{% generation %}` template; Qwen3-Instruct-2507 renders history
stably and needs no filtering.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from datasets import load_dataset

def single_turn(row):
    roles = [m["role"] for m in row["messages"]]
    return roles.count("assistant") == 1 and roles[-1] == "assistant"

out = Path("./cache/dataset/perfectblend-qwen3-8b-regen-single-turn")
out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
ds = load_dataset("./cache/dataset/perfectblend-qwen3-8b-regen-messages", split="train")
ds.filter(single_turn).to_parquet(out / "train.parquet")
```

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.precompute_eagle3 \
  --target-model Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
  --input-data ./cache/dataset/perfectblend-qwen3-8b-regen-single-turn \
  --output-dir ./cache/eagle3_qwen3_8b_maskgen \
  --mask-generation-prompt
```

```yaml
recipe_args:
  cached_target_path: ./cache/eagle3_qwen3_8b_maskgen
  mask_generation_prompt: true
```

The online backends (`colocated`, `remote`) need only the `recipe_args` key, under the same
template constraint; see the commented line in `eagle3/qwen3_eagle3_perfectblend.yaml`.

For DSpark targets too large to fit on one node (DeepSeek-V4-Flash, GLM-5.2), a
**distributed** precompute (`precompute_dspark_dist.py`) loads the target frozen
through the same expert-parallel and FSDP2 path as online training and writes the
identical cache. It is config-driven and launched with `torchrun` like multi-node
training. Each rank forwards its own contiguous slice of the dataset and writes its
own global-indexed shards straight into the shared `cache_output_dir` (no merge step):

```bash
torchrun --nnodes=4 --node-rank=0 --nproc_per_node=8 \
  --master-addr=<NODE0_IP> --master-port=29500 \
  -m nemo_automodel.recipes.llm.precompute_dspark_dist \
  -c examples/speculative/dspark/deepseek_v4_flash_dspark_precompute.yaml
```

Then set the matching training config's `recipe_args.cached_target_path` to that
`cache_output_dir` to train the draft with no live target. See
`dspark/deepseek_v4_flash_dspark_precompute.yaml` and
`dspark/glm_5.2_dspark_precompute.yaml`.

EAGLE drafters learn best when the assistant turns in the training data are
produced by the **same model** that will serve as the inference target. Most
public chat datasets were generated by other models, so their assistant tokens
are off-distribution for the drafter. `components/speculative/regenerate.py`
replaces those answers with fresh ones from the target model.

Use it when you want a drafter for a specific target but your only conversational
data came from a different model, or when you have a curated prompts dataset
(ShareGPT, UltraChat, an internal corpus) and want its answer distribution
aligned with the target. If a regenerated set already exists on the Hub (for
example `frankleeeee/PerfectBlend-Regenerated-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`), skip this
and point `recipe_args.train_data_path` straight at it.

### Two-Step Flow

The script talks to an OpenAI-compatible chat-completion endpoint, so the target
must already be served. The examples use SGLang. vLLM or any other
OpenAI-compatible server works too.

1. Start the target server (use `--tp 2` or higher to shard a multi-GPU
   target):

   ```bash
   python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --port 30000
   ```

2. Regenerate against the running server:

   ```bash
   python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.regenerate --input-data Aeala/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered --output-dir ./regenerated/sharegpt_llama31_8b --target-server http://localhost:30000/v1 --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --concurrency 64 --shard-size 1000
   ```

For each sample the script loads the `messages` column (HF Hub id, local
parquet, or JSON/JSONL, same loader as `ChatDataset`), drops every trailing
`assistant` turn while keeping the leading `system / user / ...` context
(intermediate assistant turns in multi-turn conversations are kept), calls
`/v1/chat/completions` on the target with that prompt, appends the response as the
new assistant turn, and writes the rebuilt conversations to `shard-NNNNNN.parquet`
files of `--shard-size` rows each.

The run is resumable: rerun with the same `--output-dir` and `--resume` to skip
shards already on disk. A `manifest.json` guards resume, so changing the input
dataset, split, target model, or shard sizing fails fast instead of silently
mixing incompatible shards.

The output is a parquet dataset with a `messages` column, exactly what
`ChatDataset` (used by `build_eagle3_dataloader`) consumes. Point the recipe at
it:

```yaml
recipe_args:
  target_model_name_or_path: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  train_data_path: ./regenerated/sharegpt_llama31_8b
  val_data_path: null
```

### Regeneration Tuning Knobs

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--concurrency` | 32 | In-flight requests; raise to saturate the target server. |
| `--shard-size` | 1000 | Smaller shards mean more frequent checkpointing and more files. |
| `--max-new-tokens` | 1024 | Cap per-answer length. |
| `--temperature` | 0.0 | Greedy by default; drafters are typically trained against argmax answers. |
| `--top-p` | 1.0 | Only relevant with `temperature > 0`. |
| `--timeout-s` | 600 | Per-request timeout; bump for very long generations. |
| `--max-retries` | 3 | Retries on 5xx, 429, and transport errors with exponential backoff. |
| `--split` | `train` | Supports HF slice syntax, e.g., `train[:10000]`. |
| `--shuffle-seed` | unset | Optional shuffle before slicing. |

### Regeneration Pitfalls

- **Wrong model name.** `--model` is the name sent in the OpenAI payload. It must
  match what the server serves. SGLang uses `--model-path` as the served name by
  default, so mirror `--served-model-name` here if you set it.
- **Server not warm.** Send one curl request to the server first. Otherwise the
  script retries then fails on the first batch.
- **Tokenizer mismatch.** The regenerated dataset is consumed by `ChatDataset`,
  which applies the target model's chat template at training time. Make sure the
  recipe's tokenizer comes from the same model id you used for `--model`, or the
  loss-mask alignment silently drifts.

Datasets are consumed by `ChatDataset`: a `messages` list of `{role, content}`,
or a `conversations` column (ShareGPT or OpenAI style) that is auto-converted.

## Context Parallelism for Draft Training

`distributed.cp_size > 1` shards the sequence across ranks for long-context draft
training. The draft's attention runs as a differentiable ring
(`eagle/ring_attention.py`, with a load-balanced zig-zag layout in
`zigzag_ring_attention.py`). `target_cp.py` prepares the target-side inputs.

The constraints are enforced, not advisory: every combination below raises at
setup rather than training something subtly wrong.

| Constraint | Applies To |
|---|---|
| Cannot combine with sequence packing (`packed_sequence_size > 0`). CP shards the sequence and strips the block-causal mask packing relies on | EAGLE-1/2, EAGLE-3, DFlash, DSpark |
| Co-located target backend only; the remote backend runs the target out-of-process | EAGLE-3 |
| Cannot combine with tensor parallelism (`tp_size > 1`) | DFlash |
| Dense Qwen3-style draft only | DSpark |
| EAGLE-3 draft attention must be the `Eagle3LlamaAttention` ring path; architectures without it (the DeepSeek MLA draft) raise `NotImplementedError` | EAGLE-3 |

## During-Training Tools (EAGLE-3)

Both are opt-in, off unless their block sets `every_steps`, and both run their
work in a **detached subprocess on GPUs the training run does not use**, so
`cuda_visible_devices` is required rather than defaulted.

### Periodic Real Acceptance Length (`decode_eval`)

Training loss and simulated accept length are proxies. The acceptance length that
matters is the one an inference engine produces from the draft and the target.
`decode_eval` snapshots the draft every `every_steps` optimizer steps, serves the
snapshot, benchmarks it, and reports the engine's real `accept_length` back into
the training log and W&B.

```yaml
decode_eval:
  every_steps: 500
  cuda_visible_devices: "7"     # required: a GPU the training run is not using
  target_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  input_data: /path/to/eval.jsonl
  num_speculative_tokens: 4
```

A cycle whose predecessor is still running is skipped rather than queued, so a
cadence faster than one eval takes will simply measure less often.

### On-Policy Regeneration (`regen`)

The draft is trained against target answers, and those answers age as the draft
changes what it is asked to draft. `regen` periodically regenerates a slice of the
corpus with the target and swaps the fresh shards into the dataloader. The swap
happens at an epoch boundary (a mid-epoch dataloader rebuild would disturb the
sampler), so a completed cycle waits for the next boundary.

```yaml
regen:
  every_steps: 1000
  cuda_visible_devices: "6"
  target_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  input_data: /path/to/prompts.jsonl
```

## Serve and Benchmark a Trained Draft

### SGLang

After training, serve the target and draft through SGLang:

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.serve_sglang --target meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --draft /path/to/run/epoch_0_step_1000/model --algorithm EAGLE3 --num-steps 3 --num-draft-tokens 4
```

`serve_sglang.py` resolves the consolidated `model/` directory, rewrites the
draft `architectures` to SGLang's canonical name, and regenerates SGLang's
speculative token map from `eagle_meta.pt` when needed. SGLang is not bundled. The
tool exits with an install hint if it is missing.

Measure acceptance length and speedup against the running server:

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.bench_sglang --server http://localhost:30000 --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --input-data <prompts-dataset> --baseline-server http://localhost:30001
```

It reports `accept_length` (mean tokens per verify step), `acceptance_rate`,
output throughput, and a `speedup` ratio compared to an optional non-speculative
baseline server. Point it at a freshly started server, since SGLang reports a
server-cumulative average.

### vLLM

`serve_vllm.py` is the vLLM companion. It serves EAGLE-3, P-EAGLE (vLLM's
parallel-drafting runtime, vLLM >= 0.16), and the DFlash family (vLLM's `dflash`
method, vLLM >= 0.20):

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.serve_vllm --target Qwen/Qwen3-8B --draft /path/to/run/epoch_0_step_1000 --port 8000
```

The speculative method is auto-detected from the draft config (`dflash` for a
DFlash-family draft, else `eagle3`), the draft `architectures` are rewritten to
vLLM's registered names, and `--num-speculative-tokens` defaults to `num_depths`
(P-EAGLE) or `block_size - 1` (DFlash). Pass `--print-only` to inspect the
resolved `vllm serve` command without launching. DFlash notes: vLLM reserves
`1 + K` query tokens per sequence, so a large block size might need a smaller
`--max-num-seqs` (forward it through the trailing extra args, for example,
`-- --max-num-seqs 32`); a JetSpec draft carries `dflash_config.causal=true` so
vLLM matches its causal in-block attention (pass `--dflash-causal` for
checkpoints trained before the recipe stamped it); Domino drafts are rejected
because their GRU correction head has no vLLM runtime.

`bench_vllm.py` measures the same metrics against a running vLLM server, reading
the spec-decode counters from vLLM's Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint. The counters
are snapshotted before and after the workload and differenced, so the numbers
cover exactly the benchmark's own requests:

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.bench_vllm --server http://localhost:8000 --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B --input-data <prompts-dataset> --baseline-server http://localhost:8001
```

### Multi-Dataset Sweep

`bench_sglang.py` and `bench_vllm.py` measure one dataset per invocation, but the same draft's acceptance rate can vary sharply by task. A draft tends to accept more tokens on conversational data than on math or code data because their token distributions differ from the training mix.

`bench_sweep.py` drives either engine through several datasets in one pass. It reports a per-dataset table and a completed-weighted aggregate, eliminating the need to run each single-dataset script and collate the results manually:

```bash
python -m nemo_automodel.components.speculative.bench_sweep --engine sglang --server http://localhost:30000 --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

The default suite is the four benchmarks the EAGLE / EAGLE-2 papers report
acceptance and speedup on: MT-Bench (first turn), HumanEval (code), GSM8K
(math), and Alpaca (single-turn instruction-following). None of these ship a
chat-messages column, so each is read through `--prompt-column` (a raw text field
wrapped into a fresh single-turn user message) rather than
`--messages-column`; both flags are also available on `bench_sglang.py` /
`bench_vllm.py` directly for a single custom dataset. Pass `--engine vllm` to
sweep a vLLM server instead, `--baseline-server` for the speedup column,
`--datasets <name...>` to run a subset, and `--datasets-config <path.yaml>` to
swap in an entirely custom dataset list (see
`bench_sweep/spec_bench_datasets.yaml`, which mirrors the built-in default and
doubles as a template). One dataset failing to load or benchmark is reported
as an error row and excluded from the aggregate rather than aborting the sweep.

**`--engine sglang` caveat with more than one dataset:** SGLang's
`avg_spec_accept_length` is a server-cumulative running average with no
reset/delta API, so sweeping several datasets against one live SGLang server
means every dataset after the first reports a blend with prior datasets'
traffic, not an independent number (a warning is logged when this applies).
Restart the server between datasets for independent numbers, or use
`--engine vllm`, which diffs its Prometheus counters per dataset and has no
such caveat.

## Inference-Engine Compatibility

| Draft | SGLang | vLLM |
|---|---|---|
| EAGLE-1/2/3, EAGLE-3.1 | yes | yes |
| P-EAGLE | no (tracked upstream) | yes (parallel-drafting runtime, >= 0.16) |
| DFlash, JetSpec | no | yes (`dflash` method, >= 0.20) |
| DFlash 2 | not yet wired here (`--speculative-algorithm DFLASH` upstream) | not yet wired here (`dflash` method upstream) |
| Domino | no | no (the GRU correction head has no engine runtime) |
| DSpark | no | not yet (runtime in development upstream, unreleased) |

`serve_sglang.py` rejects P-EAGLE drafts with an actionable error. Serve those on
vLLM.

## Config Reference (EAGLE-Style Schema)

EAGLE-1/2/3/3.1, P-EAGLE, and the LLM DFlash recipe share one schema. The DFlash
**DLLM SFT** configs under `../dllm_sft/` use the standard AutoModel SFT schema
(`step_scheduler` / `model._target_` / `dataset._target_` / `dllm` / `dflash`
blocks) instead.

### Top-Level Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `recipe` | Recipe class name (required). |
| `recipe_args` | Main training block (below). |
| `dist_env` | `backend` (nccl), `timeout_minutes`. |
| `distributed` | Optional; only for MoE / large targets. `strategy: fsdp2`, `tp_size`, `pp_size`, `cp_size`, `ep_size`, `activation_checkpointing`, `sequence_parallel`. Absent means DDP. |
| `optimizer` | `lr`, `betas`, `weight_decay`, optional `warmup_ratio` (0.05), `min_lr_ratio` (0.1). |
| `checkpoint` | `enabled`, `checkpoint_dir`, `model_save_format: safetensors`, `save_consolidated`, optional `restore_from` (`LATEST` / subdir / path). |
| `fp8` | Optional; torchao FP8 draft training, same surface as the SFT recipes. See [FP8 Draft Training](#fp8-draft-training). |
| `compile` | Optional; in-place torch.compile of the draft (`CompileConfig`). Strongly recommended with `fp8`. |
| `peft` | Optional, EAGLE-3 only; LoRA draft adaptation (`PeftConfig`). See [LoRA Draft Adaptation (EAGLE-3 Only)](#lora-draft-adaptation-eagle-3-only). |
| `wandb` | Optional; `project`, `entity`, `name`. |

### DFlash-Family Validation Metrics

When `recipe_args.val_data_path` is set, DFlash, DFlash 2, Domino, and JetSpec
report globally reduced `val_loss`, token-weighted `val_accuracy`, and
block-weighted `val_accept_len`. Domino also reports final-head and base-head
loss, base accuracy, and base acceptance length. DFlash 2 reports its two loss
terms (`val_base_loss`, `val_selector_loss`), the backbone's own top-1 accuracy
and acceptance length (`val_base_accuracy`, `val_base_accept_len`), and
`val_candidate_recall` -- how often the true token is in the top-k candidate
list, the ceiling the selector can reach. The reductions sum raw token and block
statistics across ranks before division, so uneven valid-token counts do not
bias the result.

Adding a top-level `wandb:` block uploads these values as `val/loss`,
`val/accuracy`, `val/accept_len`, and the corresponding Domino base-head keys.
Training logs include `train/loss`, `train/accuracy`, `train/accept_len`, and
the method-specific Domino diagnostics.

### `recipe_args` Common to All Methods

`target_model_name_or_path`, `train_data_path`, `val_data_path`, `train_split`,
`val_split`, `output_dir`, `seq_length`, `micro_batch_size`,
`grad_accumulation_steps`, `num_workers`, `num_epochs`, `freeze_embeddings`,
`trust_remote_code`, `shuffle_seed`, `log_every_steps`, `max_grad_norm`. Optional
checkpoint cadence: `ckpt_every_steps`, `save_checkpoint_every_epoch`.

### Method-Specific `recipe_args`

| Key | Methods | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `draft_num_hidden_layers` | EAGLE-1/2, DFlash | Stacked draft decoder layers. |
| `hidden_loss_weight`, `token_loss_weight` | EAGLE-1/2 | Defaults 1.0 / 0.1. |
| `ttt_steps` | EAGLE-3 / 3.1 | TTT unroll depth; integer ≥ 1 (required). |
| `draft_vocab_size` | EAGLE-3 family | Compress the draft `lm_head`; omit for full vocab. |
| `selected_token_ids_path` | EAGLE-3 family | Reuse a cached draft-vocab map. |
| `aux_layer_ids` | EAGLE-3 | Override the default low/mid/high recipe `[1, n//2-1, n-4]`. |
| `draft_attn_implementation` | EAGLE-3 | `eager` (default) or `flash_attention_2`. |
| `fc_norm`, `norm_output` | EAGLE-3.1 | Both default false; either alone is a valid intermediate config. |
| `draft_weights_path` | EAGLE-3 | Warm-start the draft from a consolidated safetensors export (file or directory); required for meaningful LoRA adaptation. |
| `target_model_backend`, `remote_urls`, `target_prefetch_depth`, `remote_timeout`, `remote_max_retries` | EAGLE-3 remote | See [Target Backends](#target-backends). |
| `cached_target_path` | EAGLE-3 / DSpark offline | Path to a cache produced by `precompute_eagle3.py`, `precompute_dspark.py`, or (large sharded targets) `precompute_dspark_dist.py`. |
| `parallel_drafting`, `num_depths`, `num_draft_layers`, `down_sample_ratio`, `down_sample_ratio_min`, `mask_token_id`, `sequence_partitions` | P-EAGLE | `mask_token_id` is required (no default). `sequence_partitions > 1` splits each sequence by dependency lineage to bound long-context memory. |
| `block_size`, `num_anchors`, `loss_decay_gamma`, `mask_token_id`, `target_layer_ids`, `attention_backend` | DFlash (LLM recipe) | Block drafting knobs. |
| `conv_kernel_size`, `conv_group_size`, `selector_rank`, `selector_top_k`, `selector_loss_weight` | DFlash 2 | Convolution and path-selector knobs on top of the DFlash set. |
| `draft_sliding_window` | DFlash family | Bounds how far back a block reads the target context; unset attends over the whole prefix. |
| `draft_num_attention_heads`, `draft_num_key_value_heads`, `draft_head_dim` | DFlash family | Size the draft's attention independently of the target's; default to the target's shape. |

| `kd_temperature`, `kd_chunk_size` | JetSpec | Forward-KL distillation knobs on top of the DFlash set. |
| `markov_rank`, `markov_head_type`, `confidence_head_alpha`, `confidence_head_with_markov`, `ce_loss_alpha` | DSpark | Markov / confidence-head knobs on top of the block-drafting set (`block_size`, `num_anchors`, `mask_token_id`, `target_layer_ids`, and so on). |
