"""The Torch definition of MSA block selection, the oracle ``select_blocks`` is checked against.

Nothing dispatches to this, so it is free to be the slow, obvious statement of the rule: it scatters
the keys into workspace rows and scores every query against every key block at once. That costs
``index_heads * tokens * workspace_rows`` fp32 values, about 1.3 GiB at the largest fixture here, so
it is sized for tests and not for a real microbatch.
